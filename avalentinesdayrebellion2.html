              <h2>A Valentine’s Day Rebellion</h2>
              <h3>Chapter Two</h3>
              <h4>Friday, February 13th, 1998</h4>
              <p>“Okay,” gasped Neville as he practically fell into the Room of Requirement. “We’re on. Kreacher will make sure
                everyone gets an invitation at breakfast. You are certain they are unreadable to the teachers, right?”</p>
              <p>
                “Only the person holding the invite can read it,” Ginny confirmed as she helped Winky put ready some food the house elves
                had generously provided, “and even then there is an Age Lock so no one of over nineteen can read it. You
                got the Secrecy charm worked out?”</p>
              <p>
                “Yeah. I have all we need to know here. I would feel better if you didn’t have to be Secret Keeper though. Harry would want
                you safe and out of harm’s way.”</p>
              <p>
                “Neville!” Ginny shook her head in exasperation. “We discussed this! I handwrote all of the invites especially because I
                have to be the Secret Keeper. You know the Carrows already suspect you for most of the DA’s tricks, even
                the times when something happened while you were in class or detention. You know they’ll be extra hard on
                you if they find out we did this. It’s safer for all of us if I’m the one to do it.”</p>
              <p>
                “Still…” Neville wavered, but Ginny cut him off: “Anyway, it’s too late now to change the plan! You know the Secret Keeper
                is the only one who can divulge the information, whether it’s spoken or in writing. Unless you are going
                to write hundreds of invites as well as charm them in a single night?”</p>
              <p>
                Neville flopped down in the armchair. “Fine. But tell me the truth now, since we can’t change the plan anyway. You knew all
                this when you volunteered to do the invitations in the first place? You can’t still claim you handwrote all
                of them just for that personal touch, as you claimed last week. You knew if you wrote them, you would have
                to be the Secret Keeper. Didn’t you?”</p>
              <p>
                For once, Ginny had the grace to blush and look embarrassed: ”Yes. I knew. I’ve known for two and a half years how it worked,
                since before my fourth year. Dumbledore wrote a note to my parents when we moved into the Order’s Headquarters
                that summer, and they couldn’t tell us about it but they had to let us read the note. I didn’t know the charms
                and all that to work it though, I was telling the truth when I told you to research that part.”</p>
              <p>
                Neville rolled his eyes. “Well, thank you for your honesty. I still wish you would have told me but too late now. Let’s just
                get this over with, okay? Before I change my mind and call this whole hare-brained scheme off…”</p>
