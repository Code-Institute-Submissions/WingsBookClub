      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Hello and Welcome to Wings' Book Club!</p>
      <p>Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Wings. I'm from Belgium. I'm an enthusiastic reader and an occasional writer. If I'm not doing either of those, I can usually be found knitting my latest project. Pretty soon, I may be able to add software creation to that list!</p>
      <p>Reading and creative activities are truly an escape for me when life gets too much, and as a person diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, I am rather prone to overload when my senses are working overtime.</p>
      <p>My favourite escape is in fantasy books, first and foremost Harry Potter. On Pottermore I was sorted in Hufflepuff.</p>
      <p>"Chicklit" fiction can also be great for tuning out and getting lost in a story. They're mostly what I choose for easy reads on sunny afternoons when I can lounge in the garden.</p>
      <p>And then there are times when you really want some fresh new story, something you haven't read yet, something short (or not quite so short) for a change. Those are the times for discovering unpublished stories, fan fiction and similar. I've got a few of those for your delectation on this site too - just check out My Stories and Friends' Stories if
        you're up for it.</p>
      <p>So make yourself comfortable, grab yourself a cuppa of your prefered beverage and happy reading!</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Jo but everyone calls me Wings.</p>
      <p>I'm a self-confessed chocoholic and bookaholic, but if I had to choose between the two, chocolate would be the first
        to go.</p>
      <p>Seriously, that's how much I love reading!</p>
