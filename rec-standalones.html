      <h2>Hello and Welcome to my Book Club!</h2>
      <p>Here, I'll be posting about all the books I love to read, of which there are
        <i>
          <b> a lot</b>
        </i>!</p>

      <p>Feel free to grab one off the shelf and make yourself comfortable with a cuppa. The kettle is always on!</p>

      <h1>Recommendations</h1>
      <h2>Stand-Alones</h2>
      <p>While I love reading series, there are occasionally times when I don't feel up to reading a full series. These stand-alone
        books are great for those times when you just want an easy read without having to remember too much of the plot for
        the next part.</p>
      <p>As I've mentioned in the introduction, I especially love these for lazy sunny weekends in the garden. They're great
        company to take on holiday as well as you can pack in a few different stories and thus have more of your fictional
        friends by your side at the pool!</p>
      <h3>Woman To Woman</h3>
      <h4>by Cathy Kelly</h4>
      <p>I think I might be addicted to this book. I've bought it at a second-hand shop over ten years ago and have read it
        at least once a year since then!</p>
      <p>It probably helps that one of the two main characters is my namesake
        <i>and</i> hails from County Sligo in Ireland, my second home. Reading it the first time felt like going home, so it's
        always on standby for when I get 'homesick' for Ireland.</p>

      <h3>The Little Shop of Happily Ever After</h3>
      <h4>by Jenny Colgan</h4>
      <p>A more recent favourite, this story is about a booklover and librarian who gets made redundant. She hates to leave
        the books she loves so much behind and finds a way to keep matching books to the right readers. A truly inspirational
        tale about making the best of a bad situation.</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Jo but everyone calls me Wings.</p>
      <p>I'm a self-confessed chocoholic and bookaholic, but if I had to choose between the two, chocolate would be the first
        to go.</p>
      <p>Seriously, that's how much I love reading!</p>
