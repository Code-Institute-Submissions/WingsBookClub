      <h2>Hello and Welcome to my Book Club!</h2>
      <p>Here, I'll be posting about all the books I love to read, of which there are
        <i>
          <b> a lot</b>
        </i>!</p>

      <h1>My Stories</h1>
      <p>You want to read my writings? Aww, shucks, thank you! Hope you enjoy them and feel free to drop me a line to say what
        you think of them. Contact information is at the bottom of the page.</p>
      <p>Now, as you can see, most of these are fan fiction. I discovered fan fiction at a time in my life that was really difficult,
        being bullied at school pre-diagnosis as well as some troubles at home. Fan fiction saved my life, and you can take
        that literally. Through writing stories, I found I could get out the emotions safely as well as get someone - even
        a fictional character - to say the words I needed to hear. Many of those old stories are therefore a bit on the dark
        side; I will add warnings to individual stories if that is the case.</p>
      <p>Happy Reading!</p>

      <p>Summary: We’ve all grown up with stories about evil dragons, hoarding gold and eating young maidens. In the old tales
        no young girl is safe, not even a king’s daughter, when a nation wishes to protect itself from the evil dragon.

        But what if dragons aren’t all evil, greedy and bloodthirsty creatures? This is a story about a different sort of dragon.</p>
