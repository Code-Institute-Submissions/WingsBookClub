## What is it?
A 5-page website (with subpages still to be added for stories) made using **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Bootstrap**.


## What does it do? 
It's currently a static website for sharing book reviews and stories.


It contains transitions to make text appear on tapping on / hovering over the cover photo of a book or story. This was done by creating a div that contained the background and then inserting a second div with the content, which has an opacity of 0 until hovered/tapped, when it becomes visible (opacity: 1). Credit where due: Niel McEwen of the Code Institute Tutor team suggested this approach when my original attempt (using an overlaying picture and transitioning to opacity 0) turned out to block the links. For clarity's sake, the code itself was written by me.


**JQuery** has been added to the document to make Bootstrap components such as the navbar work properly.
The forms are not yet active, this will be added at a later stage.



## Has it been tested?
Yes, it has been **tested on multiple browsers and devices**.  
The HTML5 and CSS3 have also been validated with **C3W Mark-up Validator** and **C3W CSS Validator**, all errors have been corrected.
